        h3 Attendance Policy
        ul.none
            li Class attendance is not required, but it is <b>STRONGLY ENCOURAGED.</b>
            li When a class is missed, it is the STUDENT'S responsibility to obtain any notes, assignments, etc. from classmates.
            li Lab attendance is required. <b>YOU WILL RECEIVE A ZERO FOR ANY UNEXCUSED MISSED LABS.</b> A zero lab grade cannot change!!!
            li Excused absences must be approved by your <b>lecture, lab, or recitation instructor.</b> <b>BE PROACTIVE!!!</b>
            ul.none
                li For labs, send an email to cs162-ta@engr.orst.edu with <b>CS 162 Lab Absence in the subject.</b>
                li For recitations, send an email to cs162-recitation@engr.orst.edu with <b>CS 162 Recitation Absence in the subject.</b>
                li For class absences, send an email to parhammj@engr.orst.edu with <b>CS 162 Course Absence in the subject.</b>
            li Students are still responsible for lab work missed even when their absence was excused.
            li Students can ONLY make-up in-class exercises with an approved absence. <b>BE PROACTIVE!!!</b>
            li Please, be on time for lecture AND turn off your cell phone ringer because it can be disruptive to other students, as well as the instructor.
            li <b>Laptops and other electronics are NOT allowed during lecture, unless approved by the instructor.</b> There is a study that shows you lower yours and your peer's grade by using a laptop in the classroom: <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/laptop-use-lowers-student-grades-experiment-shows-1.1401860">Laptop Study</a>. In addition, there are studies that show traditional note taking by hand aids in a student's learning: <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/linguafranca/2014/08/25/why-im-asking-you-not-to-use-laptops/?cid=cr&amp;utm_source=cr&amp;utm_medium=en"> Another Study</a>. Our course requires those who have authorization by the instructor to sit in a particular section of the classroom to prevent distracting others.
            li If the instructor is late for a lecture or a TA is late for lab, please remain in the classroom for 10 minutes.
            li You must remain in the lab until (your work is complete or until the lab period has ended) <b>and viewed/graded</b> by a lab instructor.


        h3 About My Courses
        ol 
            li BE PROACTIVE, don't be reactive!!!
            li BE RESPECTFUL, no one is perfect. Programming is difficult, and everyone in the class comes with different skills. The brain is a muscle and needs a work out in this area. You weren't born programming, you learned with practice. Please read the document on <a href="community.html">establishing a positive community</a>.
            li HAVE A GROWTH MINDSET!!! Everyone around you does not know more than you:) On the other hand, you do not know everything!
            li "For every teacher there are two learners." This is a learning environment for all skills. You can learn from helping others.
            li ACTIVE LEARNING! I need YOU to participate.
            li "...it is far more honorable to fail than to cheat."
            li "The task of the modern educator is not to cut down jungles but to irrigate deserts."

            li Some parts of the lab will be group work while others will be individual work.  You can submit one copy for any portion of the lab that is group work.
            li Labs are graded on a 10-point scale and primarily based on participation and effort, rather than correctness.
            li You are <b>required to bring a laptop to the lab</b>.
            li These labs are supposed to enhance the lectures using hands-on learning.

            li Assignments are to be turned in before Midnight (<strong>by 11:59pm) on Sunday night, otherwise the assignment is late.
            li You will turn in your assignments through hand-in on the 
                a(href="https://secure.engr.oregonstate.edu:8000/teach.php?type=want_auth") TEACH website.  
            li Programs are evaluated on how well they solve the assigned problem (adherence to program specification), proper formatting/use of comments, and creativity:) 
            li <b>Only one late assignment is allowed during the term</b>. This assignment will be accepted without penalty up to 3 days from the original due date. Outside of 3 days, the assignment will not be accepted!!!  You turn in your assignment to TEACH, just as you would normally.
            li Programming assignments in this course are graded by demoing your work for 10 minutes with a TA. You are required to <b>meet with a TA</b> within two weeks of the due date to demo. You can schedule a demo with a TA on the <a href="../index.html">home page</a> in the far right column of the bottom table labeled "Grading Hours".

            li <b>Missing a Demo:</b> If you miss your demo with a TA, you will receive a 10 point (one letter grade) deduction to that assignment for each demo missed.

            li If you have a problem with an assignment grade, <b>you must contact your TAs through EMAIL</b> within ONE WEEK of receiving your grade.  After one week, you will not be able to dispute your grade.
            li Remember to use your TAs because they are the ones who execute, read, and grade the assignments.

        h4  Exams - 30%  (15% each exam)
        ul.none
            li The are 2 total exams for this course.

        h4  Proficiency Demo <span style="color: red">(Ability to Keep a Passing Grade (C or above)!)</span>
        ul.none
            li You will take a pass/fail live proficiency coding demo during the lab in week 10.
            li There will be a practice demo given in week 5 with material from the first half of the class. In the practice demo, you will be scored on a pass/almost/no-pass score to give you feedback on where you stand in the class.
            li If you do not have a passing grade in the class (below C), then failing the proficiency demo cannot hurt your grade because you are not expected to be proficienct (C or above) in the class to move forward.  However, if you have a passing grade in the class (C or above),then you are expected to pass the proficiency demo to keep your passing grade in the class, i.e. <b>you cannot receive higher than a C- without passing the proficiency demo.</b>
            li Do not freak out!!!  If you have a passing grade for your assignments and YOU have been the one to do the work, then you should be able to pass the proficiency demo program.
            li A student must notify the instructor BEFORE the final demo to schedule a make-up.

        p * REMINDER: A passing grade for core classes in CS is a C or above. A C-, 72 or below, is not a passing grade for CS/ECE majors.

        h3 Academic Dishonesty
        p.indent I encourage students to work together and learn from one another on labs and assignments. However, I do expect you to turn in your OWN work for every assignment. Assignments are NOT paired-programming, and all assignments are checked for similarities with others in the class, prior class assignments, and work published online!!! Working with someone does not include copying someone else's work and changing a small amount of that work, such as variable names, comments, spacing, etc. During group assignments you and your partners may turn in one assignment per group with everyone's name attached. Working together is discouraged on exams and the final. At NO point should you copy work from the internet, and if you do copy material from an external resource, then you need to cite the resource and author(s). Paying someone to complete you work is unacceptable and will result in immediate referral to the university!!! Cheating and plagiarism are not taken lightly!
        p You will receive a zero on your first abuse of these rules, and in the case of shared work, the student sharing the work and the student copying the work will both receive zeros. In addition, the academic dishonesty charge will be documented and sent to your school's dean and the Office of Student Conduct <a href="http://studentlife.oregonstate.edu/studentconduct/faculty"> http://studentlife.oregonstate.edu/studentconduct/faculty</a> The bottom line is: Each student is expected to understand all aspects of the programs s/he submits for credit!!!

        p Please, read the university dishonesty policy:
        a(href="http://studentlife.oregonstate.edu/studentconduct/faculty")  OAR 576-015-0020 (2) Academic or Scholarly Dishonesty




        h3 Students with Disabilities
        p "Accommodations for students with disabilities are determined and approved by Disability Access Services (DAS). If you, as a student, believe you are eligible for accommodations but have not obtained approval please contact DAS immediately at 541-737-4098 or at http://ds.oregonstate.edu. DAS notifies students and faculty members of approved academic accommodations and coordinates implementation of those accommodations. While not required, students and faculty members are encouraged to discuss details of the implementation of individual accommodations."

        p Students with documented disabilities who may need accommodations, who have any emergency medical information the instructor should be aware of, or who need special arrangements in the event of evacuation, should make an appointment with the instructor as early as possible, and no later than the first week of the term. Class materials will be made available in an accessible format upon request.




        h3 Religious Accommodation of Students Policy

        p Oregon State University recognizes a diverse group of students, and the university accommodates diverse religious holidays. Please read the policy on religious accommodations for students:

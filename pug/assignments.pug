            p Please read the <a style="color:#0000FF" href="161_style_guideline.pdf">style guidelines</a> for this class.
            
            p Even though these are guidelines and not a standard for this class, 10 points of each assignment grade is based on having program and function headers, proper indentation, and vertical spacing between statements. BE CONSISTENT!!!
            
            p EVERY assignment in this course is <b>graded by demoing your work for 10 minutes with a TA</b>. You are required to <b>meet with a TA within two weeks of the due date</b> to demo.

            p <b>Demo Outside 2 Weeks:</b> Assignments that are not demo'd within the acceptable time period will be subject to a 50 point deduction.
            
            p <b>Demo Late Assignments:</b> Late assignments must still be demoed within the two week demo period beginning from the assignment's original due date.

            p <b>Missing a Demo:</b> If you miss your demo with a TA, you will receive a 10 point (one letter grade) deduction to that assignment for each demo missed.

            <h3>Attendance Policy</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <li>Class attendance is not required, but it is <b>STRONGLY ENCOURAGED.  There are unannounced in-class exercises factored into your final grade.</b></li>
                <li>When a class is missed, it is the STUDENT'S responsibility to obtain any notes, assignments, etc. from classmates.</li>
                <li>Lab attendance is required. <b>YOU WILL RECEIVE A ZERO FOR ANY UNEXCUSED MISSED LABS.</b> A zero lab grade cannot change!!!</li>
                <li>Excused absences must be approved by your <i>lecture</i> instructor. <b>BE PROACTIVE!!!</b></li>
                <li>Students are still responsible for lab work missed even when their absence was excused.</li>
                <li>Students can ONLY make-up in-class exercises with an approved absence. <b>BE PROACTIVE!!!</b></li>
                <li>Please, be on time for lecture AND turn off your cell phone ringer because it can be disruptive to other students, as well as the instructor.</li>
                <li><b>Laptops and other electronics are not allowed during lecture</b>, unless approved by the instructor. There is a study that shows you lower yours and your peer's grade by using a laptop in the classroom: <a style="color:#0000FF" href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/laptop-use-lowers-student-grades-experiment-shows-1.1401860">Laptop Study</a>. In addition, there are studies that show traditional note taking by hand aids in a student's learning: <a style="color:#0000FF" href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/linguafranca/2014/08/25/why-im-asking-you-not-to-use-laptops/?cid=cr&amp;utm_source=cr&amp;utm_medium=en">Another Study</a>. Our course requires those who have authorization by the instructor to sit in a particular section of the classroom to prevent distracting others.</li>
                <li>If the instructor is late for a lecture <u>or</u> a TA is late for lab, please remain in the classroom for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>You must remain in the lab until (your work is complete <u>or</u> until the lab period has ended) <b>and</b> viewed/graded by a lab instructor.</li>

                <li>BE PROACTIVE, don't be reactive!!!</li>
                <li>BE RESPECTFUL, no one is perfect. Programming is difficult, and everyone in the class comes with different skills. The brain is a muscle and needs a work out in this area. You weren't born programming, you learned with practice.</li>
                <li>HAVE A GROWTH MINDSET!!! Everyone around you does not know more than you:) On the other hand, you do not know everything!</li>
                <li>"For every teacher there are two learners." This is a learning environment for all skills. You can learn from helping others.</li>
                <li>ACTIVE LEARNING! I need YOU to participate.</li>

                    <li>You can finish <b>up to 3 points of the lab at home</b> and bring it with you to the next week's lab for a grade. You must show your update from the previous lab within the first 15 minutes of the current lab to redeem points on the prior lab, otherwise the work is not accepted.
                    </li>
                    <li>If you have a problem with a lab grade, <b>you must contact your lab instructor through EMAIL within ONE WEEK</b> of receiving your grade. After one week, you will not be able to dispute your grade.</li>

                    <li>Attendance is required for recitations, and <b>YOU WILL RECEIVE A ZERO for the attendance and quiz portion of ANY UNEXCUSED MISSED RECITATION!!!</b> </li>
                    <li>You MUST attend the recitation in which you are registered, unless receiving permission from the professor PRIOR to missing the recitation!!!
                    </li>

                    <li>EVERY assignment in this course is <b>graded by demoing your work for 10 minutes with a TA</b>. You are required to meet with a TA within two weeks from the due date to demo. You are <b>penalized for failure to demo within two weeks or missing a scheduled appointment.  <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure to demo within two weeks receives an automatic 50 point

                    <li>There will be a practice demo given in week 5 with material from the first half of the class. In the practice demo, you will be scored on a pass/almost/no-pass score to give you feedback on where you stand in the class.</li>
                    <li>If you do not have a passing grade in the class (below C), then failing the proficiency demo cannot hurt your grade because you are not expected to be proficienct (C or above) in the class to move forward. However, if you have a passing grade in the class (C or above), then you are expected to pass the proficiency demo to keep your passing grade in the class, i.e. <b>you cannot receive higher than a C- without passing the 
   proficiency demo.</b></li>

            <h3>  Academic Dishonesty </h3>
            <blockquote>
                I encourage students to work together and learn from one another on labs and assignments. However, I do expect you to turn in your OWN work for every assignment. <b>Assignments are NOT paired-programming, and all assignments are checked for similarities with others in the class, prior
class assignments, and work published online!!!</b> Working with someone does not include copying someone else's work and changing a small amount of that work, such as variable names, comments, spacing, etc. During group assignments you and your partners may turn in one assignment per group with everyone's name attached. Working together is discouraged on exams and the final. At NO point should you copy work from the internet, and <b>if you do copy material
from an external resource, then you need to cite the resource and author(s)</b>. Paying someone to complete you work is unacceptable and will result in immediate referral to the university!!! Cheating and plagiarism are not taken lightly!
                <br>
                <br> You will receive a zero on your first abuse of these rules, and in the case of shared work, the student sharing the work and the student copying the work will both receive zeros. In addition, the academic dishonesty charge will be documented and sent to your school's dean and the Office of Student Conduct

                <p>
                    The bottom line is: Each student is expected to understand all aspects of the programs s/he submits for credit!!!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please, read the university dishonesty policy, <a style="color:#0000FF" href="http://studentlife.oregonstate.edu/studentconduct/faculty">

            <h3>  Students with Disabilities </h3>
            <blockquote>
                "Accommodations for students with disabilities are determined and approved by Disability Access Services (DAS). If you, as a student, believe you are eligible for accommodations but have not obtained approval please contact DAS immediately at 541-737-4098 or at http://ds.oregonstate.edu. DAS notifies students and faculty members of approved academic accommodations and coordinates implementation of those accommodations. While not required, students and faculty members are encouraged to discuss details of the implementation of individual accommodations."
                <p>
                    Students with documented disabilities who may need accommodations, who have any emergency medical information the instructor should be aware of, or who need special arrangements in the event of evacuation, should make an appointment with the instructor as early as possible, and no later than the first week of the term. Class materials will be made available in an accessible format upon request.
